title: "How do I store and manage my 'data' / 'files'?"
category: general

In this day and age, taking and storing digital data especially *documents* is trivial. It's inevitable and everyone has to do it at some point or the other.

I like keeping things organized neatly and avoid storing unecessary files, books, documents, items and even redundant information. I hate storing my data locally; *Cloud* is the way to go, it makes the data easy to acess from any computer and keeps the working environment consistent and clutter free.

To be able to do this, I need an application / software / method which is

* **Sync** - ability to sync across all my devices. That includes all my Linux OS, Windows OS and Android OS.
* **Clean** - void of unecessary distractions and options; *Clutter free* U.I
* **Easy** - Adding / removing / updating of data must be easy and intuitive.
* **Flexible** - Editing / backups / upgrading / future-shifting must be easy to do.
* **Indexed** - what's the point of storing files if you can't access the contents at the right time?

#### Keeping the above points in mind, I chose the following services:

* **Dropbox**:

	I was torn out between [Dropbox](https://dropbox.com) and [Evernote](https://evernote.com) for my note taking requirements.
	Evernote provided tons of features including OCR, searchable files and tons of other features. But it had some major flaws:

	* It wasn't available on linux natively. Yes, the web app worked but it was slow and clunky.
	* Most of the things which made Evernote awesome was locked behind a paywall of $5 per month (cheaper in India ~â‚¹240 per month).
	* Even after trying out premium for a month, I wasn't satisfied because Evernote lacked Markdown support. I'm a huge fan of writing stuff in markdown. It's easy, future-proof and flexible. This was a huge factor for me to avoid Evernote.

	Whereas Dropbox was available natively for Linux, Windows and Android, supported any type of files and was **extremely flexible** (specially when used with a shell/terminal). Thus, I decided to store all my notes in dropbox which then instantly got synced everywhere. Even though Dropbox has a limit (currently ~4.5 GB for me), it can be upgraded to 16GB worth of free space by referring friends or completing tasks, which I believe is *more than enough* for **notes, files, documents and code**.

* **Google Drive**:

	All the data apart from text will be stored in google drive. Since I have a couple of gmail accounts and google provides a total of 15 GB free space (for all their services), storing media and other heavy files should be no issue for the near future. If ever I do need more space, Drive provides 100 GB of extra space for only $1.99 per month which I believe is a better bang for buck when compared to Evernote Premium.

* **Hard Drive**:

	For everthing else, i.e: old photos, family videos, phone backups and pretty much anything which is rarely used; I prefer a good ol' Western Digital 1 TB HDD. It's cheap, effective but risky. Which is why I have a backup of that data on other HDD's :D)

****

Recently **Amazon Drive** released a new plan of allowing to store unlimited data for only **$59.99**/**YEAR**, which I think is absolutely mind blowing. Let's see how it goes and how it affects pricing of it's competitors, especially Google and Dropbox.
