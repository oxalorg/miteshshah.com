title: "June Tasks [2015]"
---

I'm trying out different ways to track tasks which I want to accomplish,
like I stated in [Expirements](/blog/experiments),
which has lead to my first try on the matter.

<!--more-->

It's a rough outline of what I'm looking forward in the coming 2 weeks, i.e till the end of June.

* **Python**: I find Python interesting. The minimal syntax and space indentations coupled with a very intuitive library makes me just want to learn Python for no other reason.
	- Learn the basics.
	- Complete the Interactive course from Rice University.
	- AutomateWithPython Book
	- Solve problems on competition/coding sites.
	- Learn to create scripts.
	- *Look into PyGame?*

* **C++**: I've been coding in 'C' for far too long now. I've heard C++ is quite similar, so might as well deal with it now.
	+ Read code and get comfortable.
	+ Solve problems on competition/coding sites
	+ Research about different libraries available.

* **Javascript**:
	- Learn the absolute basics.
	- Watch ['Crockford on Javascript'](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7664379246A246CB) videos.

* **Meditation**:
	- Meditate with complete mindfulness for 2 minutes every day.
	- Light sitting with no distractions for 5 minutes every day.
