I can do whatever I want. Don't ever let yourself get fooled
again. The brain WILL try to fool you. Why, you may ask?
Simply because it doesn't like expending energy, the path of
least resistance, remember?

Decide something. Do it. There is nothing between you and your
goal, except for fake excuses created by your brain. Don't
give in to them. Don't try to rationalize them. I've observed
them, and every single one of them is nothing but a pile of
bullcrap. Nothing good has ever come by even thinking about
the myriad of useless reasons your brain tries to justify,
just to avoid doing something you want to do at any given
moment.

Why do we think that we need breaks every few minutes? Why
do we persist in watching TV, playing games, or listening to
music every single day, as if it were a necessity without
which the human could not survive. Why do we believe
everything the society leads us into believing? Break out
of these shackles and you will see the hellhole you've been
anchored in.

Easier said then done eh? This is not something you will be
'doing'. This is something you will become. Don't try to do
all this. Don't try to force it onto yourself. Try to be one
with it. Try to make it your nature. Undergo an attitude
shift. Change your life. Change yourself.
