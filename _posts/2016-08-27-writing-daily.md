I've always thought of writing *something* every day. Be
it some random crap I want to share, some important event,
some good'ol realisation, or just something which I want to
document.

<!--more-->

I barely use any of the social medias, so I barely share stuff
with people. Maybe this is a chance for me to share *(rather,
learn to share)* my life.

I also feel that the mere act of writing something daily, be
it about me or not, will change the way I perceive things. It
will lead to me taking *different* decisions. And even if it
doesn't, and my life has remained a constant for too many days
in a row, I'll know that there is something I need to change.

Imagine the life of a caveman, or that of a hunter-gatherer
community, I'm sure if they had written blogs, they'd be
interesting as hell.

But writing something daily is a little more personal than
your average blog post. It's a window into *how I live my
life*. It's as good as following (*or stalking*) me around for
the entire day. As long as I don't discuss any future events,
I should be safe from online predators and trolls (*although
no one actually reads my shit lol*).

I'll start writing daily from today at [/ox/life/](/ox/life).

UPDATE 2016-10-27: I've decided to take my life blog offline. 
I didn't feel comfortable in sharing that.
