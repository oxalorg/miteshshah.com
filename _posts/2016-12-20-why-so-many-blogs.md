I've created a lot of blogs over the past year and a half.
Most of them have been to try and learn programming in a new
environment. So regardless of wether I write actual content
is irrelevant because the blogs have served their purpose
already. Though I *do* want to produce content, I *do* want
to share it, and I absolutely *do* want people to read it.

I've been experimenting, and testing the waters since quite
a while now. It's time to set things in stone. I need a
map and a compass to go about my journey, and this
article seems to be exactly that.

## All my blogs

### Tech

My very first domain/website was [computableverse.com][1].
I was excited and I started *learning* just so I could blog
about it. I'd say the very act of buying the domain name
was the greatest impetus to my thirst for knowledge.

Unfortunately I started mixing a bit of personal content in
there and then I lost focus. I wrote a lot of articles but
never published them, because at that point I really was
writing **for myself**. I barely even advertised it to my
friends or family.

### Personal domain

Then I bought [miteshshah.com][2] and posted personal stuff
there. Soon I started feeling uncomfortable sharing personal
thoughts with the world and scrapped the blog. Now it's
just a site so that people can google my name and find me.
Also serves very handy for a professional email.

### A *weird* initiative

I've always been curious about philosophy, anthropology, and
the psycology of how we function. Nothing fancy, just big words
and some specific questions which we all wonder about. I wanted
to write about them and put it out there in a clear and concise
way, so that it could help someone. Also, I wanted to learn
*django*, so I went ahead and created [EarthlyHumans.com][3].

Haven't posted anything on it yet. Since I'm not even sure what
I want to post anymore.

### The way of the shinobi, the birth of a rogue

This is when I made [oxalorg](/). This is the ***epic odyssey of
the rouge intergalactic time travelling ninja***. I used to 
imagine a world.. actually this is another story for another time :)

### For the wise knows nothing

I started going deeper and deeper into philosophy. It spoke
to me strongly. Even though I've been distracted lately, I plan
on posting my findings, learnings, and thoughts on this new blog
[OwlOfAthena.com][4].

## So what you doing m8?

I just want to produce great content. And I want to keep doing it.
Because that's the best goddamn way to learn.
