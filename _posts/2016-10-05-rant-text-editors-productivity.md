title: Small rant on text editors and productivity

I think I might have stumbled upon the secret of getting things done. The long lost secret of being *productive*. It's simple: "use what works until it doesn't". That's it. If you just intuitively ***get*** this, that's amazing. If you want my points of view on the matter then read on. (Beware: It's just a goddamn long rant on my history with text editors)

<!--more-->

This all started a couple years ago. When I used notepad to write small programs. I quickly got tired of it, and moved onto a simple IDE which I received with my programming book, "CodeBlock". It was simple. It worked. I was happy. I coded.

Then I moved onto doing some Java, and obviously, code blocks wasn't working. I switched to eclipse but found it too confusing. So I started using notepad++ along with command line compiling. It was simple. It worked. I was happy. I coded.

Then I stumbled upon some heavy dependencies for a Java project I was working on (writing bot scripts for a game I used to play), and notepad++ wasn't enough. So I took out some time to learn eclipse just enough to get things to work, and surprisingly they did. It was simple. It worked. I was happy. I coded.

Then I stumbled upon this sneaky little kid in class who was apparently really clever. Linux. The command line tools blew me away. I quickly became a fan of the terminal and tried doing what all the c00l l33t kids were doing. I started learning vim.

But since I sucked at vim, I still coded things which I wanted to "get done" in gedit.

Everyone told me that once you master vim, you're beyond godlike. It's the one true way to be a programmer, and that I'm a nobody if I don't have a customisable text editor because that's what programmers do. They think and they type. I was a naive 2nd year college student. I believed in the wisdom of the elder greybeards whom I stumbled upon in the forest of the internet. They have a hat, a robe, and a shiny staff, they must be wise, I thought.

Fast forward a couple of years, I was still learning vim because I kept giving up. When I wanted to "get things done", I used Atom and Sublime instead of gedit, because they just worked. 

But I knew that my training would pay as I was ALMOST near mastering my vim-fu.

Then I stumbled upon emacs, and every single thing which frustrated my bones in vim was easily solvable in emacs. Also they had evil mode. I spent days researching on it and finally decided to take the plunge.

Oh boy. The spiral repeats.

Fast-forward to now. I'm still learning emacs while still using Atoms when I want to get things done. Some say I am not patient enough, or a 1000 other reasons on why a true programmer must master their own tools. But to hell with those reasons.

Yes, I am still pretty fast in VIM than I am in Atom. But what about when I want to run a debugger. What about when I want split panes. What about when I want to jump between function declarations. I still am not comfortable with all these in vim. And I can't even get started on debugging. It's a pain in both vim and atom. (It's a breeze in IDEs though, I installed CLion and got started with it and the debugger tool in a mere 5minutes)

I know, I know. I am not using *XYZ* plugin, or the *ABC* package. Oh just stop. Let me be at peace right now. Let me remove this agony once and for all.

Maybe I'm not smart enough to use vim, or emacs, or org-mode. Maybe I don't want to learn vim script, or elisp, or goddamn coffeescript and nodes. Maybe I need someone else to do all this for me so I can spend most of my time thinking and debugging. Because I think about code 10 times, debug it 10 times, read it 10 times, but only write it once.
