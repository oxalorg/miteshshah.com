After over 25 days of studying, my 6th sem exams finally came
to an end.

I'm super excited. I had all these cool ideas during these
days which I didn't have time to do.

So here's a *rough* note of some of the things I'll be doing
for a week or so.

<!--more-->

* Make a programming language. - Pretty simple right? :P
  - I already have a pretty sound grasp on the *theory*
of compilers. Now it's time to implement one.
  - Might have to refresh on compiler concepts.
* Make a personal photo hosting solution 
  - I really need a way to upload images I use instantly. 
  - May include screenshot+insta upload. 
  - Should include access to api. 
  - Possible authentication? 
  - Secure possible authentication? 
* Make a personal analytics app 
  - y u so complicated google analytics? 
* Follow through the SICP [video lectures](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE18841CABEA24090) from MIT.
  - learn mi some functional :P
