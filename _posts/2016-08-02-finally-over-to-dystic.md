Damn have I been working since a long time to port this blog
over to [dystic](github.com/miteshninja/dystic). This is the
first post which I'll be publishing via dystic. I hope it
works \**fingers crossed*\*.

I've spent a lot of sweat and time in making this and I
absolutely love it. A lot more polish is needed, and tons of
more features to make it a one stop solution for my blogging
needs.

See you on the other side.
