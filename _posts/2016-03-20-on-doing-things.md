title: On doing things

Some things are inherently tough. Some things appear to be,
and some things we assume to be tough. But when does something
*actually* become hard? Isn’t the degree of ‘something’ just
an illusion? Because after all, it depends on nothing but our
own resilience.

There are several ‘jobs’ or mini activities we do every
single day; like say for example, cleaning our room, going
to school, checking email, eating food, listening to music,
organizing your notes, and countless more. We don’t rate each
of these equally. Our brain *already* knows the priority,
subconsciously. But since our life is an aggregation of
several of these little jobs, we must strive to prioritize
them more consciously.

We do these jobs for some kind of reward. May it simply
be the satisfaction of doing, or completing it. Or for a
thousand more reasons, but a reason nonetheless. Why is it
that we judge these tasks so unjustly. We never think about
them mindfully, we have presumptions about every single one
of them. Some tasks, like cleaning our room, inadvertently
appear to be daunting. But others like listening to music, or
watching TV don’t. On the contrary, if I had only 5 minutes of
free time before I had to go do something else, it would be
much more easier to just clean my room, which is definitely
doable in 5mins if done every few days, rather than firing up
an episode of Modern family. And since it can be done in so
less time, almost a fourth of watching an entire T.V. episode,
it surely must be easier.

Then when does a job truly become difficult? I think, that
it becomes difficult when you subconsciously feel that the
reward it reaps is not worth it when compared to a ‘junk-job’
providing instant gratification.

So what if we started prioritizing our tasks more consciously?
What if we thought through why we chose to act and do things
before actually doing them. Maybe tons of daily entertainment
is not what we need to feel *full*, maybe it provides us with
a sense of achievement which we fail to obtain form other
parts of out life. Maybe we can take a more rational approach.
And *maybe* we can still feel satisfied.

*Authors notes:*

Providing some context on what led me to think the above
prose. I played a game called ‘Runescape’ when I was small,
and I absolutely adored it. I gradually shifted away from it,
but decided to try it again this week, simply out of curiosity
and nostalgia. Well, enough said, I got hooked on to it. I
wasted almost a week just playing it and having the time
of my life. I absolutely do not think that it was a waste.
It’s *OKAY* to enjoy once in a while, after all I did manage
to stay game-free for about 3 months before this week. But
I started prioritizing the RuneScape-job much higher than
the jobs I used to give more priority, like programming and
watching South Park (and shamefully, even having a bath).

This got me thinking. And I thought about everything from a
different perspective, I tried to mentally jot down all the
inputs and outputs of me doing this RuneScape-job. It turns
out, it’s not that much different than watching South Park or
listening to music, except that this is much more active and
social. There is a sense of achievement in getting that Level
80 Ranged or slaying 1000s of monsters. A sense of achievement
which I’ve been lacked of in my life lately.

I used to hack around softwares, websites, and write scrips
to do all sort of crazy stuff. That was extremely fun and
satisfying, not to mention extremely insightful. I haven’t
been doing that in the past month, thanks to my rather
busy schedule, which , I believe, led me to take refuge
in RuneScape as my primary source of satisfaction and
Achievement.

But now that I consciously and mindfully broke it down
into pieces, I get it. I can see the bigger picture. I can
consciously chose to play RuneScape for only a few hours
every week and keep everything balanced *while* enjoying the
nostalgia and the fun which it provides.
