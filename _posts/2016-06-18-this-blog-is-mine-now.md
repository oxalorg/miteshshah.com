I don't know how humans behave. But I do know that a
majority of the people have happily hopped onto the social
media bandwagon. Everyone, even the more recluse and quiet
loving people, have fallen prey to the cold stabbing of the
technology abusing demon. These thoughts resonate with those
of your friends who dissentingly keep reminding us about the
evil wrath of social media which has enslaved us. However they
do not resonate with me, yet it's important to know both the
sides of a coin.

I, on the other hand, am absolutely appalled by the *magic*
that internet is. Even though having understood the finer
intricacies of TCP/IP, it still feels like magic to me. The
world however, has taken it for granted. We, collectively,
have not only lost the fascination towards *magic* but have
also left our inner child behind by becoming preoccupied with
thoughts and activities which, in the grand scheme of things,
will turn us into emotional robots.
