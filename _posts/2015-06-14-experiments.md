I like experiments. They are fun. They give you data. That data gives you an insight into something which would otherwise be extremely hard to recognise.

This is a generic list of the experiments I wish to conduct.

* A few..
	- days without a phone.
	- days without games.
	- days of unknowing.
	- days of silence.
	- days of paleo-sleep schedule.
	- of only laptop (no desktop).
* Try different methods of note taking.
* Try different ways to track tasks:
	- Daily?
	- Weekly?
	- Bi-weekly?
	- Monthly?
	- Quarterly?
* Calculate and eliminate my software dependencies.
