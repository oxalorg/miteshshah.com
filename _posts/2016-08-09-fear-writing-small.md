The fear of writing small. The fear of writing less. It's
always haunted me. I've always felt like writing something
relevant with extreme brevity only to discard it by accusing
it of being too little.

I will now consciously try to break this by posting smaller
posts as long as they are self contained and cohesive. Because
for other random thoughts I already have a well sorted place.
