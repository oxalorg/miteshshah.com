title: You shall not write

To be honest, I am so distracted that I simply don't get the
time to do trivial things. Watching out of the balcony for
more than a few minutes seems daunting, if not impossible.
Going to the toilet without a book or a phone seems like
a *waste* of my *precious* time. This attitude has sifted
through the filter of these mundane activities, into almost my
entire life.

I'm constantly trying to reason with myself whether doing
something is *worth it*, whether it's the most *efficient* use
of my time, or I simply feel remorse if I can't do anything
and god forbid have to wait 5 minutes without a smart device
by my side.

There's a constant fear of Artificial Intelligence taking
over, at least among the super paranoids and the super
geniuses, but why can't we see that the machines have already
taken over. Take a look at your left, now take a look at your
right; more than 90% of those things have been touched by
machines. Do we really need those things for our survival?
Have we confused survival with luxury?

Writing is something which feels like an innate faculty
blessed upon us by Mother Nature herself. It's the only thing
which, among the countless distractions of the modern life,
feels truly natural. It enables me to be *me*, by forcing
me to explore my thoughts and moulding them into something
concrete.

Maybe all is not lost yet. Maybe we still are humans and
*maybe* we can learn to live with the machines and the earth
in a sustained way. Maybe we can take some time for ourselves.
Maybe we can get bored once in a while. Maybe it's okay to not
make a billion dollars, and maybe it's alright if you can't
become a celebrity. Maybe life has something more to it, and
*maybe* we just need to do nothing but observe, *closely*.
