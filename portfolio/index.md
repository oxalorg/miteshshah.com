## Current

- Final (4th) year Computer Science undergraduate student.
- Technical writer at [Computable(verse);](http://computableverse.com/)

## Past experiences:

* **Full Stack web developer at Mahabali Innovative Technologies**:
Developed a production ready flask web application using Python and deployed it on a linux VPS behind an
nginx server using the uwsgi protocol to interact with the web application. Also deployed capabilities to send and
receive email customized to the client requirements with web足hooks installed in places to make sure the emails
are getting delivered. Website is capable of handling a load of over 1000 concurrent connections at any given
time, and easily scalable by upgrading the server.

## Side projects:

* **Ninshu**: A complete compiler/interpreter for a self made programming language which borrows its syntax from C
and Python. Lexing, tokenization and parsing is done using PLY, python ports of lex/yacc. The parsed code is
then converted ianto an abstract syntax tree using the visitor dispatching method after which it is run over and
interpreted.

* **ghPublish**: A complete command line blogging solution using GitHub Pages. It allows the users to start
publishing posts on their jekyll and github powered blogs instantly. Supports authentication by creating api
access tokens and storing them locally for multiple users. Posts written in markdown can be rendered to html
and previewed locally. It uses the GitHub API and hence does not need git and jekyll installed on the client
system.

* **dystic**:足A static site generator using dynamic principles. Instead of using dynamic code and accessing a server
side database, it treats the filesystem itself as a database creating a complete static website. Supports selective
building, and hierarchical WYSIWYG model of structuring content. Also supports complete markdown rendering
and html templating.

* **sakura**:足A drop in css framework which works out of the box on your entire site without having to change
anything in your existing HTML files. It works directly on inbuilt HTML tags and is completely responsive for
mobile usage. Supports duo足tone color customization.

* **VisaApplication**: Android application to process and manage visa applications of employees. All the data and
business logic is stored in a remote server which is accessible using a json api. Provides email notifications to
users who registered or have been selected by the higher staff to be selected for further processing.
